Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Part A

What do you see in the plots for ticks and time?
A quadratic relation between the number n and the tick or time. And as n increases, tick or time increases. The range of time is smaller than tick.

How would you characterize those curves?
A quadratic relation between the number n and the tick or time. And as n increases, tick or time increases.

Based on the current code for addLast, why do you see this behavior?
1+2+3+4+... = n*(n-1)/2

Part B

What behavior do you see now for appending n items to a list if you use a tail reference?
A linear line.

While we have reasoned so far only about time, if we are adding n elements to the end of a list, what is the asymptotic complexity of the additional space required when using the tail reference?
n

Under what conditions would you recommend using a linked list with a tail reference vs. a linked list without at tail reference?
If you want to add an element at the beginning of a linked list, we recommend using a linked list without a tail reference, whereas if you want to add an element at the end of a list, you should use a tail reference.

Part C

Why does getSize() take the time it does?

How did you achieve Î˜(1) performance for getSize()?
